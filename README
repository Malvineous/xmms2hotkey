// What is it?
////////////////

This is a client for the XMMS2 media player.  It has no user interface, rather
it monitors certain keys and buttons and tells XMMS2 to perform a specific
action when those keys are pressed.

All configuration is done through the config file.  By default this is
~/.config/xmms2/clients/xmms2hotkeys.conf.  For new installations, copy
xmms2hotkeys.conf.sample there and modify it.  Details are included in
the sample file's comments.

// Features
/////////////

 * Supports X11 keys, like most other hotkey programs.  Also supports mouse
   buttons as hotkeys.

 * Supports evdev keys, unlike most other programs.  This will allow you to
   use hotkeys in the console, without X-Windows running.  This will work with
   any evdev supported device (mouse, keyboard, joystick, etc.) and will still
   work with X11 running.

 * Supports multikey combinations.  You can assign a single trigger hotkey,
   so that other keys only work while the trigger key is being pressed.  For
   example, if you set your trigger key to F10 and the up/down arrows to skip
   to the prev/next track, you will be able to use the arrows normally, but
   press F10+Down to skip to the next track.

   This is perhaps most useful if you have a spare mouse button, as you can
   hold that down and use the rest of the mouse (wheel etc.) for manipulating
   XMMS2, without interfering with normal use of the mouse.

   The main limitation with this is that all hotkeys must be on the same
   device.  (So you can't press a key on the keyboard to switch the mouse
   buttons over to XMMS2 mode.)

// Notes
//////////

 * If autorepeat is bothering you (e.g. holding down the play/pause key causes
   rapid pause/resume actions) you can disable the autorepeat for individual
   keys if you're using X11 hotkeys.  (This applies to X11 in general and is
   not specific to xmms2hotkeys.)  You will probably want to leave autorepeat
   enabled for those hotkeys you might hold down though, such as the volume
   controls.  Run "xset -r 123 -r 456" to disable repeat for keycodes 123 and
   346.  See the manpage for xset for further details.  xmodmap might also be
   useful to set up other modifiers in addition to shift, control, etc.)

 * Using evdev hotkeys works fine under X11 (and means you can load
   xmms2hotkeys at system startup - music while you log in) however any
   keys being used for XMMS2 actions won't be hidden from X11.  This means
   any X11 apps will still see the keys you're pressing (so if you use the
   'a' key to start playback, pressing 'a' will not only start playback, but
   make the letter 'a' appear in whatever X11 program you're using.)
   If this is a problem, either use xmodmap to hide the key from X11 or use
   the X11 bindings instead.
